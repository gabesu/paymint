# Paymint
A Paystack Design Challenge.

### Challenge: Design a payment form.
1. The payment form will have a switcher to change between bank payment and card payment.
2. Both payment views should be designed.
3. When the pay button is clicked, it should transition to successful payment.
4. You can use whatever technologies you choose.

### Idealogy.

I believe Payment needs to be Quick, Secure and Beautiful. These three things guided my design for this challenge.

### Process.
1. The UI was designed first using Sketch.
2. I used SASS with RCSS styling structure. Check http://rscss.io/
3. Icons are courtesy of http://fontawesome.io/
4. I used Adobe Illustrator for the logo design and made an animated GIF of it in Adobe After Effects.
5. CSS Animations using CSS Keyframes and CSS Transitions with some JQuery to spice things up.

### Thank You :)
